(*| # Demo: FastExp loop invariant

We verify an efficient implementation of exponentiation, which requires a clever loop invariant.

The code being verified is the following:

```go
// FastExp returns b to the power of n0
func FastExp(b uint64, n0 uint64) uint64 {
	var a uint64 = 1
	var c = b
	var n = n0
	for n > 0 {
		if n%2 == 1 {
			a = a * c
			n = n / 2
		} else {
			n = n / 2
		}
		c = c * c
	}
	return a
}
```

(*| This is the invariant that makes the proof work. The inputs all directly
   correspond to the code's variables. Remember that [n0] is the initial value and
   we're computing [b^n0] while [n] is a mutable variable. |*)
Definition fast_exp_inv (b n0 a c n: w64) :=
  (* [i] is the iteration count, which isn't tracked in the code *)
  ∃ (i: Z),
  let b := uint.Z b in
  let n0 := uint.Z n0 in
  let a := uint.Z a in
  let c := uint.Z c in
  let n := uint.Z n in
  0 ≤ i ∧

  (* The code works by processing [n0] one bit at a time, accumulating the
  result in [a]. [n] starts out at [n0], then on each iteration its divided by
  two to process the remaining bits.

  It turns out to be easy to express the accumulator with the iteration count:
  it's [b^(n0 % (2^i))] - the exponent is the i low-order bits of [n0]. [n] is
  always [n0 / (2^i)], the high-order bits of [n0]. Finally, when [n%2 = 1], the
  code needs to incorporate one more bit of [n0], which it does by multiplying
  by [c], which has the value [b^(2^i)] (this last part is easy to see in
  isolation - every loop iteration does [c := c * c]).
   *)

  (* One subtlety about [c]: it actually might overflow on the last iteration,
  but the overflowed result isn't used, so we only state this when [0 < n] and
  the loop is still ongoing. Luckily we don't need [c] when the loop exits, only
  [a]. *)
  (0 < n → c = b^(2^i)) ∧
  n = n0 `div` (2^i) ∧
  a = b^(n0 `mod` (2^i)).

(*| The main difficult reasoning about this code is to show that the above loop
invariant is (1) `fast_exp_inv_init`, the invariant holds with the code's
initial values, (2) `fast_exp_inv_done`, when the loop exits, `a` has the final
result we want, (3) `fast_exp_inv_odd` and `fast_exp_inv_even`, which show the
invariant is preserved by the body (with the proof divided into two cases, one
for each branch).

All of these proofs don't have any program reasoning, it's all just mathematical
proofs about arithmetic (albeit including the complications of finite-precision
machine arithmetic).
