(*| ## Loop invariants in theory

The general idea for proving the correctness of a loop is to invent a _loop invariant_, an assertion that is (1) true when the loop starts, and (2) _if_ the loop invariant holds at the start of the loop, it should hold at the end. If you prove these two things, due to an induction argument, you've proven that the loop invariant is true at the end of the loop. That's it; this is the main idea.

In practice, loops have one more complication, which is that they exit when a specific condition is met, so when they terminate we know that condition holds. This is what tells us that the loop ran for the "correct" number of iterations.

Here's the principle of loop invariants stated formally:

$$
\frac{
\hoare{I(\true)}{body \, ()}{\fun{(r: \mathrm{bool})} I(r)}
}{
\hoare{I(\true)}{\mathrm{loop} \, body}{I(\false)}
}
$$

where $\mathrm{loop} \triangleq \rec{f}{body} \ife{body \, ()}{f \, body}{()}$.

This principle we've stated could just be a theorem about the function $\mathrm{loop}$. We could prove it using induction over the number of steps taken by the loop, for example, though such a low-level proof is somewhat complicated.

::: important Main idea

This theorem produces two proof obligations when used:

1. $I$ is preserved by the loop. More precisely the loop gets to assume $I(\true)$ (since the loop continues), and must prove $I(r)$, where $r$ is the continue/break boolean that the body returns.
2. The loop invariant holds initially. More precisely $I(\true)$.

The result is the assertion $I(\false)$, which is used to verify the rest of the code (after the for loop).

:::

## Using loop invariants in practice

The actual principle proven in Perennial is a bit more complicated than what we see above, because it is designed for `for` loops. A `for` loop looks like this:

```
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
  body // might use break, continue
}
```

In this code, `i := 0` is an initializer, which simply runs before the whole `for` loop and is unrelated to loop invariants. `i < 10` is a loop condition that is checked at the _beginning_ of each loop iteration, and provides one way for a loop to exit. In the middle of the loop, the code might execute `continue`; this is easy to understand as simply skipping the rest of the loop body. `break` is more complicated to reason about since it is another way for a loop to stop executing, and it means the condition is not guaranteed to be false when the loop exits. Finally, at the end of every loop iteration (unless `break` is called), the post-iteration code `i++` is executed.

While the theorem that handles all of these features is somewhat complicated, using it is pleasantly simple if you understand the idea of loop invariants.

For our first example, we'll consider a function that adds the numbers from 1 to $n$. We'll prove this produces $n(n+1)/2$.

Let's first see what this would look like without a `for` loop, using a recursive implementation and an induction argument.

Given that assumption, what we're doing is  induction on the number of steps the function takes to terminate. *)

### SumN with a loop

Now let's re-implement this function with a loop instead. Here we handle integer overflow differently: the function `std.SumAssumeNoOverflow(x, y)` returns `x + y` and panics if the result would overflow, but in the proof we ignore the overflow case. This introduces an assumption in our whole verified code that this sum never overflows.

```go
// SumN adds up the numbers from 1 to n, with a loop.
func SumN(n uint64) uint64 {
	var sum = uint64(0)
	var i = uint64(1)
	for {
		if i > n {
			break
		}
		sum = std.SumAssumeNoOverflow(sum, i)
		i++
	}
	return sum
}
```

The first proof we'll attempt for this function has a minimal loop invariant that shows that the heap loads and stores work, but nothing about the values of the `sum` and `i` variables.

We'll see that this loop invariant is indeed an invariant: we can prove it holds initially and that it is preserved by the loop. However, it's hopelessly weak for proving that `return sum` is correct after the `for` loop, which we'll fix in the next attempt.

There are two new tactics specific to for loops:

- When the next piece of code in the WP is a for loop, `wp_for` starts verifying it by reasoning about the loop body. It uses the current proof context (whatever hypotheses you currently have) as the loop invariant, so the standard pattern is to _generalize_ with `iAssert` to something weaker that holds throughout the loop. You can see this below.
- `wp_for` produces a statement `for_postcondition` whenever the loop body finishes (either due to `continue` or just by getting to the end), executes a `break` statement, or calls `return`. In each case, the tactic `wp_for_post` transforms that `for_postcondition` into whatever you should prove next: when the loop exits, that's the loop invariant; when the loop breaks, that's verifying the code after the loop; and for a `return` statement that's whatever the postcondition of the outer function is.

(*| ### Case study: Binary search

Here is a larger example with a provided loop invariant but not the correctness proof. The code being verified is the following (inspired by [the standard library's sort package](https://go.dev/src/sort/search.go)):

```go
// BinarySearch looks for needle in the sorted list s. It returns (index, found)
// where if found = false, needle is not present in s, and if found = true, s[index]
// == needle.
//
// If needle appears multiple times in s, no guarantees are made about which of
// those indices is returned.
func BinarySearch(s []uint64, needle uint64) (uint64, bool) {
	var i = uint64(0)
	var j = uint64(len(s))
	for i < j {
		mid := i + (j-i)/2
		if s[mid] < needle {
			i = mid + 1
		} else {
			j = mid
		}
	}
	if i < uint64(len(s)) {
		return i, s[i] == needle
	}
	return i, false
}
```

The standard library implementation suggests the following invariant. To relate the more general code for `Find` to `BinarySearch`, use the following relationships:

- `h` in `Find` is `mid` in `BinarySearch`
- The more general `cmp(mid)` becomes the specific comparison function `needle - s[mid]`, so that `cmp(mid) > 0` becomes `s[mid] < needle`.

The suggested invariant is the following:

> Define cmp(-1) > 0 and cmp(n) <= 0.
>
> Invariant: cmp(i-1) > 0, cmp(j) <= 0

Can you see how this invariant relates to the one below? Notice how we had to be much more precise, filling in many missing details above.

A note on Go function names: Go makes a global decision that function calls always use the package name, so other than within the standard library's sort package, the function will be invoked as `sort.Find`. That is how I'll refer to it from now on.

(*| 
The standard library implements a more general API than above, since the caller passes in a comparison function. It does not directly assume this comparison function is transitive.

### Exercise: prove the standard library sort.Find

What is Go's `sort.Find` assuming and promising? Translate the prose specification to a Coq predicate. Then, translate the invariant in the implementation to a more formal Coq predicate, similar to what you see in the proof of `BinarySearch`.

Proving the real `sort.Find` with Goose is also a possibility, with minor tweaks to the code due to Goose translation limitations. A tricky part is that `Find` is a higher-order function: it takes a function as an argument. We already saw one such function, `For`, but this was only in GooseLang; now we have to deal with one coming from Go.

|*)

(*| ### Ownership in iterators

Let's revisit the idea of ownership in the context of a loop. Consider a hashmap with an iteration API that looks like this:

```go
func PrintKeys(m HashMap) {
  it := m.KeyIterator()
  for k, ok := it.Next(); ok {
      fmt.Println(k)
  }
}
```

That is, we have an API like this (where `Key` is a placeholder for the key type):

```go
// normal operations:
func (m HashMap) Get(k Key) (v Value, ok bool)
func (m HashMap) Put(k Key, v Value)
func (m HashMap) Delete(k Key)

// iteration:
func (m HashMap) KeyIterator() *Iterator
func (it *Iterator) Next() (k Key, ok bool)
```

Given this API, is this safe?

```go
// does this work?

func PrintValues(m HashMap) {
  it := m.KeyIterator()
  for k, ok := it.Next(); ok {
      v, _ := m.Get(k)
      fmt.Println(v)
  }
}
```

What about this one?

```go
// does this work?

func ClearMap(m HashMap) {
  it := m.KeyIterator()
  for k, ok := it.Next(); ok {
      m.Delete(k)
  }
}
```

::: details Solution

You can't tell from just the API (which does not even describe ownership in comments). For most hashmap implementations, the iterator should be considered to _own_ read-only permission on the entire hashmap. This means that `PrintValues` is safe, but `ClearMap` is not. This problem is often called _iterator invalidation_ since the call to `m.Delete(k)` is considered to _invalidate_ `it` in the next iteration.
