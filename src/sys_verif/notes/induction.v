(*| ## Proving disjunctions and exists statements |*)

Inductive day : Type :=
| monday
| tuesday
| wednesday
| thursday
| friday
| saturday
| sunday.

Definition is_weekend (d: day) :=
  d = saturday \/ d = sunday.

Definition next_weekday (d: day) : day :=
  match d with
  | monday => tuesday
  | tuesday => wednesday
  | wednesday => thursday
  | thursday => friday
  | friday => monday
  | saturday => monday
  | sunday => monday
  end.

Definition next_day (d: day) : day :=
  match d with
  | monday => tuesday
  | tuesday => wednesday
  | wednesday => thursday
  | thursday => friday
  | friday => saturday
  | saturday => sunday
  | sunday => monday
  end.

Lemma weekend_next_day_weekend (d: day) :
  d = friday \/ d = saturday ->
  is_weekend (next_day d).
Proof.
Admitted.
(*| Proving an [exists] is complicated and we'll have more to say, but try to
think through this intuitively for now. |*)
Lemma wednesday_has_prev_day : exists d, next_day d = wednesday.
Proof.
  exists tuesday.
  simpl. reflexivity.
Qed.

(*| ## In-class exercise: informal proof

Now let's prove something more interesting: every day has a previous day.

Think-pair-share and come up with an _informal_ proof strategy. Then I'll show how
to translate it to a Rocq proof.
|*)
Lemma every_day_has_prev : forall d, exists d', next_day d' = d.
Proof.
  (* Goal is a forall, so introduce it. *)
  intros d.
Admitted.
(*| Challenging proof: the above lemma becomes false if `next_day` is replaced
with `next_weekday`. Let's prove that. |*)
Lemma every_day_does_not_have_prev_weekday : ~forall d, exists d', next_weekday d' = d.
Proof.
Admitted.
(*| ## Exercise: safe vs unsafe tactics (part 1)

Recall some tactics we've seen:

- `intros`
- `destruct`
- `left`
- `right`
- `reflexivity`
- `simpl`
- `exists` (provides a witness when the goal is `exists (x: T), P x`)

Define an **safe tactic** as one that if the goal is true, creates only true
goals. Define an **unsafe** tactic as a not safe tactic (bonus question: can
you rephrase that without the negation?)

Which of the above tactics are safe? Why? |*)

(*| ## Proofs about recursive functions |*)

Module NatDefs.
  (* copy of standard library nat and `Nat.add` (typically written x + y) *)
  Inductive nat : Type :=
  | O
  | S (n: nat).

  Fixpoint add (n1: nat) (n2: nat) : nat :=
    match n1 with
    | O => n2
    (* notice _shadowing_ of [n1] *)
    | S n1 => S (add n1 n2)
    end.
End NatDefs.

(*| We'll go back to using the standard library definitions for the rest of the
file. |*)

Module MoreNatProofs.

Lemma add_0_l n :
  0 + n = n.
Proof.
  simpl. (* Works because [add] pattern matches on the first argument. *)
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(*| The above proof is a "proof by computation" which followed from the
definition of `add`. The reverse doesn't follow from just computation: `add`
pattern matches on `n`, but it's a variable. Instead, we need to prove this by
induction:
|*)

(** This will generally be set for you in this class. It enforces structured
proofs, requiring a bullet ([-], [+], and [*] in Ltac) or curly brace when
there's more than one subgoal.
*)
Set Default Goal Selector "!".

Lemma add_0_r_failed n :
  n + 0 = n.
Proof.
  destruct n as [|n].
  - simpl.
    reflexivity.
  - simpl.
    (* do this again?? *)
    destruct n as [|n].
Abort.

(*| Recall the _principle of induction_: if $P$ is some property of natural
numbers and we want to prove $\forall n, P(n)$, then we can do the proof as
follows:

- **base case:** show that $P(0)$ is true
- **inductive step:** for any $n'$, assume $P(n')$ and prove $P(1 + n')$.

From these two we conclude exactly what we wanted: $\forall n, P(n)$.

This is exactly what we can do with the `induction` tactic. What Coq will do for us is
infer the property of `n` we're proving based on the goal.
|*)

Lemma add_0_r n :
  n + 0 = n.
Proof.
  induction n as [|n IHn].
  - (* base case *)
    simpl.
    reflexivity.
  - (* inductive step, with [IHn] as the inductive hypothesis *)
    simpl.
    rewrite IHn.
    reflexivity.
Qed.

(*| We'll now go through some "propositional" proofs that follow from the rules for
manipulating logical AND (`∧`) and OR (`∨`).

First, let's just recall the rules with toy examples. In these examples, `P`,
`Q`, `R` will be used as arbitrary "propositions" - for the intuition it's
sufficient to think of these as boolean-valued facts that can be true or false.
They would be things like `n = 3` or `n < m`. The reason they aren't booleans in
Coq is a deep theoretical one we won't worry about.
|*)

Lemma or_intro_r (P Q R: Prop) :
  Q -> P \/ Q.
Proof.
  intros HQ.
  (*| Pick the right disjunct to prove. Similarly, `left` would leave us to
  prove `P`. |*)
  right.
  assumption.
Qed.

Lemma or_elim (P Q R: Prop) :
  (P -> R) ->
  (Q -> R) ->
  (P \/ Q) -> R.
Proof.
  intros HR1 HR2 H.
  (*| `destruct` on H, which is an `∨`, leaves us with two goals: why? what are
  they? |*)
  destruct H as [HP | HQ].
  - apply (HR1 HP).
  - apply (HR2 HQ).
Qed.

Lemma and_intro P Q :
  P ->
  Q ->
  P /\ Q.
Proof.
  intros HP HQ.
  (*| `split` turns a proof of A ∧ B into two separate goals |*)
  split.
  - assumption.
  - assumption.
Qed.

Lemma and_elim_r P Q :
  (P /\ Q) -> Q.
Proof.
  intros H.
  (*| `destruct` on an `∧` has a very different effect - why? |*)
  destruct H as [HP HQ]. (* {GOALS DIFF} *)
  apply HQ.
Qed.

(*| ### Proof trees

On board: we can visualize the effect of each of these strategies as a _proof
tree_.

|*)

(*| ### Back to nat |*)

Lemma O_or_succ n :
  n = 0 \/ n = S (Nat.pred n).
Proof.
  destruct n as [ | n']. (** Make a case distinction on [n]. *)
  - (** Case [n = 0] *)
    left.
    reflexivity.
  - (** Case [n = S n'] *)
    right.
    simpl. (** [pred (S n')] simplifies to [n']. *)
    reflexivity.
Qed.

(*| This proof uses `intros` and `rewrite`.

Coq allows you to write `intros` without arguments, in which case it will
automatically select names. We strongly recommend in this class to always give
names, since it makes your proof easier to read and modify, as well as making it
easier to read the context while you're developing a proof. |*)
Lemma eq_add_O_2 n m :
  n = 0 -> m = 0 -> n + m = 0.
Proof.
  (** The goal is an implication, and we can "introduce" an hypothesis with the
  [intros] tactic - notice the effect on the goal *)
  intros Hn.
  intros Hm.

  (*| `rewrite` is another fundamental proof technique |*)
  rewrite Hn.
  rewrite Hm.
  simpl.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(*| This lemma is a proof of a disequality, a "not equals". Even this isn't
built-in to Coq but built from simpler primitives. |*)
Lemma neq_succ_0 n :
  S n <> 0.
Proof.
  (* Wade through the sea of notation *)
  Locate "<>".
  Locate "~".
  Print not.
  (** We see that [a <> b] is notation for [not (a = b)], which is by definition
  [a = b -> False]. *)

  unfold not.

  (** Since our goal is an implication, we use [intros]: *)
  intros Hn.

  (** It is impossible for [S ...] to be equal to [0], we can thus derive
  anything, including [False], which is otherwise never provable. The
  [discriminate] tactic looks for an impossible equality and solves any goal by
  contradiction. *)
  discriminate.
Qed.

Lemma succ_pred n : n <> 0 -> n = S (Nat.pred n).
Proof.
  intros Hn.
  destruct (O_or_succ n) as [H0|HS].
  - unfold not in Hn.
    (* There are a few different ways to proceed. Here's one: *)
    exfalso. (* [exfalso] encodes the strategy of proving [False] from the
    current hypotheses, from which the original conclusion follows (regardless
    of what it is). *)
    apply Hn.
    assumption.
  - assumption.
Qed.

(*| Here's a toy example to illustrate what using and proving with AND looks
like. |*)
Lemma and_or_example (P Q: Prop) :
  (P /\ Q) \/ (Q /\ P) -> P /\ Q.
Proof.
  intros H.
  destruct H as [H | H].
  - assumption.
  - destruct H as [HQ HP].

    + assumption.
    + assumption.
Qed.

  (n = 0 /\ m = 0) <-> n + m = 0.
Proof.
  Locate "<->".
  unfold iff.
  split.
  - intros [Hn Hm].
    subst.
    reflexivity.
  - intros H.
    destruct n as [|n].
    + rewrite add_0_l in H.
      split.
      { reflexivity. }
      assumption.
    + simpl in H.
      (* in the rest of this class, more commonly [congruence] *)
      discriminate.
Qed.

(*| You can see the use of bullets `-` and `+` to structure the proof above. You
can also use `{ ... }` (used once above), which are often preferred if the proof
of the first subgoal is small compared to the rest of the proof (such as the
single-line `{ reflexivity. }` above). |*)

Lemma add_comm n1 n2 :
  n1 + n2 = n2 + n1.
Proof.
  induction n1 as [|n1 IHn].
  - simpl.
    (*| An important part of your job in constructing both the informal and
    formal proof is to think about how previously proven (by you or someone
    else) lemmas might help you. In this case we did this part of the proof
    above. |*)
    rewrite add_0_r.
    reflexivity.
  - simpl.
    (*| ## Exercise: what lemma to prove? |*)
Abort.



(*| Think before looking ahead. |*)



Lemma add_succ_r n1 n2 :
  n1 + S n2 = S (n1 + n2).
Proof.
  induction n1 as [|n1 IH].
  - simpl. reflexivity.
  - simpl. rewrite IH. reflexivity.
Qed.

Lemma add_comm n1 n2 :
  n1 + n2 = n2 + n1.
Proof.
  induction n1 as [|n1 IHn].
  - simpl.
    (*| An important part of your job in constructing both the informal and
    formal proof is to think about how previously proven (by you or someone
    else) lemmas might help you. In this case we did this part of the proof
    above. |*)

    rewrite IHn.
    reflexivity.
Qed.
